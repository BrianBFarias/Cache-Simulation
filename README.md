# Cache-Simulation
<sub>This is a Cache Simulation for the University of Florida CDA3101 course </sub>
# The following program has the below parameters
```
> Number of bytes in the cache (a positive power of 2) 
> Number of blocks in each set (associativity)
> Replacement strategy (FIFO or LRU)
> Number of bytes in a block (a positive power of 2, must be at least 4)
> 1 set of n blocks is fully associative
> n sets of 1 block is direct mapped
> n sets of m blocks is m-way set associative
```

<sub> It reads from a list of tens of thousands of random memory address in a **.txt** file </sub>
